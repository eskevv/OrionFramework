# OrionFramework
Cross-platform Game Framework using XNA and C#

Experimental and working game framework built on top of MonoGame primarily for 2D games.
3D support is already implemented but has not been extended yet for making games with it - soon to be added.

This framework can also be combined with my ECS for a different approach in creating entities.

NOTE: To test and run the included working solution - you need to run the application from the ./Tester directory
