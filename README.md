# OrionFramework

Cross-platform framework for making games in 2D with support for 3D using XNA and C#. Orion is a game library I've been working on to create 2D games that sits on top of the MonoGame framework. It provides several layers of abstractions that makes game logic easier to write. 

## Features
- Easy screen/ resolution access
- Input handling with control mapping
- Entity Component System
- Basic User Interface
- Particle System
- Scene transitions
- Simple Batcher class for primitives and textures
- Collisions
- Camera System
- Time module for delta and timers

## Dependencies 
- FirstLight (my tiling and level parser)
